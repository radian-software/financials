Got our refund from the FTB for that erroneous fine by fixing the tax
return! Or at least most of it, I still have to ask for the rest back.

I've also started paying for a phone plan (a very cheap one, $2/month)
in order to have an official business number for public record
documents and forms that insist on a "customer support" phone number,
as it's really not appropriate to use a personal cell phone for that.
