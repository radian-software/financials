At first I was using Google Workspace for business email. This was
later replaced with Fastmail, which is both cheaper and more ethical.

Legally, Radian LLC needed to pay me back in consideration for
ownership of my intellectual property in existing projects, so that is
what the $100 charge is for here.

This is from right after I set up the AWS account, so unfortunately I
don't have a detailed breakdown for it. Also, AWS offered me $200 in
credits for a new business account, so there are no bills for the next
couple months. The only thing that I was running before enabling those
free credits was Tinyku, so that's what I credited it to here.

Switched from Google Workspace to Fastmail + Nextcloud for ethical
reasons this month, it also reduces cost.

Had a trial subscription for CryptPad to evaluate as replacement for
Google Workspace. I ended up going with Nextcloud instead.

$  708.50    $ -14.00    Analytics - Fathom Analytics
$  728.50    $  20.00    Revenue - Donations - GitHub Sponsors

Also, this is when my small business free credits ran out on the
corporate AWS account, so I started getting billed for Riju on AWS.

Apparently there is literally no way to categorize or tag your EIP
usage. All tags are ignored and everything is squished into a single
combined account-wide line item on your bill. So, that’s that. Best I
can do is say the Elastic IP charges are from two EIPs, the ones for
Tinyku and Nextcloud.

=== 2022 October ================================================

$  628.80    $  -1.25    Web hosting - Amazon Web Services - Tinyku
$  623.80    $  -5.00    Business operations - Email - Fastmail
$  609.80    $ -14.00    Analytics - Fathom Analytics
$  629.80    $  20.00    Revenue - Donations - GitHub Sponsors

Cost is almost zero for Nextcloud because I keep the server off when
not in active use. The main cost is actually the Elastic IP.

I turned Tinyku down in August because it wasn’t receiving active
work, so might as well save on the costs, but turns out I forgot about
billing for the old EBS snapshots, so it took me until December to
delete those.

I turned down Fathom after October to save on costs, because analytics
are a nice-to-have, not a must.

Turning off Tinyku saved an EIP.

Now that Heroku is offline, we’re running Tidier, GNU ELPA Mirror, and
Hypercast on Railway. Using Sleeping Beauty keeps the costs pretty
controlled but I have a bit more work to do there to optimize even
further.

The Chrome Web Store verification charge was for publishing Hypercast.

BlueVine is one of the worst businesses I’ve ever had to deal with, so
switching to another bank for business checking was long overdue. We
bank with San Francisco Fire Credit Union now and I have no complaints
about them.

Honestly couldn’t tell you why the EIP bill went down, I really wish
Amazon actually broke these down in their billing.

Forgot to turn off the Nextcloud server one time for a couple days,
gonna add a cronjob to turn it off automatically at some point.

The Tinyku charge will finally go away in January now that I’ve
remembered to delete the EBS snapshots; the cost for Riju should go
down a couple dollars too.

I was working on migrating Riju off of AWS to BuyVM by Frantech, which
would decrease cost significantly (especially with the free tier
disappearing). But this did not end up materializing and I eventually
shuttered the new instance to keep things on AWS for now.

I’ve added a cron job to turn off Nextcloud automatically now, so
overruns on the billing for that should stop happening finally.

Managed to drive the costs below the Railway free tier threshold for
February, so no bill for that month!

any profit. Yay!

This month is where Railway threw a hissy-fit and deleted their free
tier. I pointed out to them that this contradicted their prior written
communications about the plans for that and they shot back some fairly
unprofessional threats about terms of service and such. So, now they
charge $5.00/month, whatever.

This $22.25 thing is because of some incorrect paperwork. The form I
mailed in with my 2022 tax return incorrectly said that my $800
minimum payment was for 2022 instead of 2023 as it actually was, even
though there was no payment due in 2022, so they said "sure, we'll
take that non-required payment for 2022, and fine you for paying it
late even though it wasn't due in the first place". I'm still working
on getting this sorted out and will ask for a refund once the revised
paperwork is processed.

Okay so $881.41, this is an even more egregious paperwork issue with
the FTB. Apparently not only did they claim an erroneous late fee on
my 2023 payment because they thought it was for 2022 despite there
being no tax that year, they also then claimed I hadn't paid for 2023,
and told me I needed to pay them again, with a second(!!) late fine.
I'm definitely going to be fighting to get this back, but at time of
writing that dispute is still in process.
